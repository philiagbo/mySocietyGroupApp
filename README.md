# Getting Involved

This application is built using NativeScript with Angular - this framework enables native cross platform development on both Android and iOS, using familiar web technologies (HTML, Angular, Javascript / Typescript). 

Due to iOS Developer licenses and limited to Mac devices etc, it's easier to build & run this application in NativeScript's Preview application on the iPhone via Windows and Linux. This can be achieved by following these instructions:

1. Install NativeScript Playground ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript-playground/id1263543946) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.play))
2. Install NativeScript Preview ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript-preview/id1264484702) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.preview))
3. [Install node.js on your machine](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
5. Install Angular by doing the following:  `npm install -g @angular/cli`
6. Install NativeScript by doing the following: `npm install -g nativescript`
7. Now clone this repository by doing the following: `git clone https://github.com/lukearran/MySociety---Group-12.git`
8. Change directory to the cloned folder
9. To run the application in Preview Mode (e.g NativeScript Preview) then do the following command: `tns preview`
10. A QR code will appear within the window, open NativeScript Playground and scan this code.
11. Wait a few minutes for the app to download a built copy of the app.
12. Make changes in code, and it will appear on the Preview App!



~~Though untested, it's possible to build and install this on Android - not got round to this yet, but will do soon and provide instructions below.~~
